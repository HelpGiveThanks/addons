###The Q&A Big Button Remix plugin

Todd Burry (original), David Matson (remixer adding in code changes authored by peregrine)

David Matson made code changes altering this plugin from v1.2.1 as specified by peregrine in this very helpful post The Big Button option part A: http://vanillaforums.org/discussion/26902/some-adjustments-to-more-clearly-see-ask-a-question-in-q-a-1-2-1-new-discussion-button.  

This remix is provided as a convenience saving you the time altering code yourself to put a big 'Ask a Question' button on your Vanilla forum, and is provided to you under a GNU GPL2 license just like the original.
